	abstract = {Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is an optically transparent thermoplastic with favorable processing conditions. In this study, a series of plastic scintillators are prepared via thermal polymerization, and the impact of PMMA content on their transparency and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) ability is investigated. The fabricated samples, comprising a polystyrene (PS)-PMMA matrix, 30.0 wt{\%} 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), and 0.2 wt{\%} 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA), exhibit high transparency with transmissivity ranging from 70.0 to 90.0{\%} (above 415.0 nm) and demonstrate excellent n/{\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}gamma{\$}{\$}discrimination capability. Transparency increased with increasing PMMA content across the entire visible light spectrum. However, the PSD performance gradually deteriorated when the aromatic matrix was replaced with PMMA. The scintillator containing 20.0 wt{\%} PMMA demonstrated the best stability concerning PSD properties and relative light yields.},

@article{Mengesha2015PlascitScintillators,
	annote = {Currently we are investigating the inclusion of organotin compounds in polystyrene material to improve plastic scintillators full gamma-ray energy sensitivity with the ultimate goal of achieving spectroscopy. Accurate evaluation of light yield from the newly developed scintillators is crucial to assess merits of compounds and chemical process used in the scintillators development. Full gamma-ray energy peak in measured gammaray spectrum, resulting from total absorption of gamma-ray energy, would be ideal in evaluating the light yield from the new scintillators. However, full energy sensitivity achieved thus far is not statistically viable for fast and accurate light yield energy calibration from the new scintillators. The Compton edge in measured gamma-ray spectrum has been found as an alternate gamma-ray spectrum feature that can be exploited for characterizing the light yield energy from the newly developed plastic scintillators. In this study we present technique implemented for accurate light yield energy calibration using the Compton edge. Results obtained were very encouraging and promise the possibility of using the Compton edge for energy calibration in detectors with poor energy resolution such as plastic and liquid scintillators.},

@article{Goodwin2023PlasticScintillator,
	abstract = {A network of specialist laboratories support the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) with re-measurements of radionuclide samples, including xenon gas. The measurement of four xenon fission product radionuclides ((133)Xe, (135)Xe, (131m)Xe and (133m)Xe) can be used to detect an underground nuclear explosion. Laboratories use a range of techniques to measure the radionuclides, including beta-gamma (β-γ) coincidence spectrometry. These highly-sensitive measurements are capable of detecting concentrations of down to 500 atoms of (133)Xe in a few cm(3) of xenon. In some detector systems, detection of the metastable isomers ((131m)Xe and (133m)Xe) can be more challenging due to interferences between the signatures of different radionuclides. Recent work has shown that using high-purity Germanium (HPGe) high-resolution gamma detectors, these interferences can be reduced, lowering the dependence of the detection limits on radionuclide sample isotopic composition. One downside of these detectors is the reduction in detection efficiency, which impacts the overall detection sensitivity; so assessing different detector systems is a priority for radionuclide laboratories. This work presents a coincidence detector system comprising of a plastic scintillator gas cell and a large-crystal high-purity germanium detector. The energy resolution, coincidence detection efficiency, MDA and interference factors are determined from measurements of synthetic radioxenon gas samples.},

@article{Zehtabvar2024Review,
	abstract = {Gamma spectroscopy is an important analytical technique across various fields. Gamma spectroscopy uses the energy spectra of emitted gamma rays to examine the type and quantity of isotopes that exist in samples. Like any other analytical technique, traditional gamma spectroscopy encounters challenges that in some cases make the analysis uncertain. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed as an approach for enhancing the precision and robustness of gamma spectroscopy. The current study introduces the basics behind ML and illustrates how they are applied in gamma spectroscopy using case studies. Major findings discussed herein demonstrate the developmental capability that ML has in improving gamma spectroscopy. Radioisotope identification, optimizing detector performance, and simplifying environmental monitoring processes have been the main areas in which ML algorithms have been deployed for improvement. These include the ability to predict and provide real-time spectrometry, among others, even though these opportunities come with their shortfalls such as the necessity for huge training datasets. This review explains that integrating ML into gamma spectroscopy marks a major change from current analytic techniques, with possible further developments in radiation detection and environmental science. It serves as very useful material for those studying or practicing AI and gamma spectroscopy and want to know more about it or need guidance on what is happening so far regarding AI integrated into gamma spectroscopy analysis.},

This scintillator was employed in conjunction with an improved discrimination system and the data were analyzed on a two-dimensional analyzer which provided a matrix of 72 x 64 channels.  At a bias level where 99% of the electron scintillations were eliminated, it was possible to obtain almost 100% counting efficiency for recoil protons of 2 Mev, and the scintillator was useful for protons down to 0.5 Mev.  The influence of various monomers, polymerization conditions, scintillating solutes, and secondary solvents was investigated, and a preliminary survey of the effects of these variables on pulse-shape discrimination is presented.

The challenge lies in discriminating signals from organic scintillators with similar shapes and short decay times. Using a single-readout phoswich detector, we successfully identified <italic>γ</italic> radiation signals from two scintillating components. Our Boosted Decision Tree algorithm demonstrated a maximum discrimination power of 3.02 $\pm$ 0.85 standard deviation in the 950 keV region, providing an efficient solution for self-shielding and enhancing radiation detection capabilities.</p>},

@article{Koo2019Feasiblity,
	abstract = {Radiation portal monitor (RPM) systems have been deployed worldwide to monitor the inflow of illegal radionuclides at border crossings. Large-sized plastic scintillation detector has been widely used for RPM system, but due to the components of the plastic scintillator of low Z-number material the poor energy resolution shows the broad energy spectrum without clear photo peak identifying the radionuclides. The aim of this study is to develop an RPM based on the scintillator array for enhancing the detection efficiency and energy resolution. Using a Monte Carlo (MC) method, an RPM comprising the multi-array hexagonal scintillator was simulated with varied diameters of 8--24 cm and thicknesses of 5--25 cm, and the performance was assessed with four radionuclides of 137Cs, 60Co, 226Ra, and 40K. To determine the optimal scintillator dimensions, the generation and collection efficiency of optical photons were assessed. The performance of the multi-array scintillator was evaluated by comparing it with the conventional single scintillator in terms of the gamma-collection efficiency and the energy resolution with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the energy weighted spectrum. The plastic scintillator of 8 cm diameter and 15 cm thickness was determined to have the optimal dimensions out of the 25 geometry conditions. The multi-array plastic scintillator showed an increased optical photon-collection probability, up to 35% more than a conventional plastic scintillator, while the FWHM decreased by more than 20%, resulting in an improved energy resolution. Based on this MC-based design and optimization study, a proof-of-principle detection system is currently being built and an experimental study to demonstrate its superior accuracy in the identification of radionuclides will also be conducted in the future.},

@article{Lee2023Radionuclide,
	abstract = {Radiation portal monitors (RPMs) installed at airports and harbors to prevent illicit trafficking of radioactive materials generally use large plastic scintillators. However, their energy resolution is poor and radionuclide identification is nearly unfeasible. In this study, to improve isotope identification, a RPM system based on a multi-array plastic scintillator and convolutional neural network (CNN) was evaluated by measuring the spectra of radioactive sources. A multi-array plastic scintillator comprising an assembly of 14 hexagonal scintillators was fabricated within an area of 50 × 100 cm2. The energy spectra of 137Cs, 60Co, 226Ra, and 4K (KCl) were measured at speeds of 10--30 km/h, respectively, and an energy-weighted algorithm was applied. For the CNN, 700 and 300 spectral images were used as training and testing images, respectively. Compared to the conventional plastic scintillator, the multi-arrayed detector showed a high collection probability of the optical photons generated inside. A Compton maximum peak was observed for four moving radiation sources, and the CNN-based classification results showed that at least 70% was discriminated. Under the speed condition, the spectral fluctuations were higher than those under dwelling condition. However, the machine learning results demonstrated that a considerably high level of nuclide discrimination was possible under source movement conditions.},

@article{LoPresti2006BaselineSuppression,
	abstract = {Radiation portal monitor (RPM) systems based upon polyvinyl toluene scintillator (PVT) gamma-ray detectors have been deployed to detect illicit trafficking in radioactive materials at border crossings. This report sets forth a characterization of the baseline suppression effect in gross-count gamma-ray profiles due to shadow shielding by vehicles entering RPMs. Shadow shielding is of interest because it reduces the alarm sensitivity of RPMs. This observational study investigated three types of PVT-based commercial RPM systems currently deployed at selected ports of entry in terms of spatial effects relative to detector panel positioning. Radiation portal monitor sites were characterized by driver versus passenger side, top versus bottom panel, and narrow lanes versus wide lanes as observed for a large number of vehicles. Each portal site appears to have a distinctive baseline suppression signature, based on percent maximum suppression relative to measured background. Results suggest that alarm algorithms based on gross-counts may be further refined through attention to individual site characteristics. In addition, longer vehicle transit times were often correlated with stronger baseline suppression, suggesting that baseline suppression studies should take transit time into account.},

@article{Jeon2023Explanation,
	abstract = { Radioisotope identification (RIID) is a representative application of deep learning for radiation measurements. Deep learning-based RIID models have been implemented in various types of radiation detectors; however, very few of these models have been interpreted using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. This paper presents an explanation of a deep learning--based RIID model for a plastic scintillation detector. The RIID task is defined as a multilabel binary classification problem, and the dataset is generated using a random sampling procedure. The identification performance is verified using experimental data. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the RIID models increased with the increase in the total counts of the dataset. Additionally, XAI methods are implemented, and their explanatory performance is verified for the spectral input. The domain knowledge of RIID for the plastic scintillation detector is that patterns near the Compton edge can be used as evidence for the existence of radioisotopes. Among the implemented XAI methods, integrated gradient and layerwise relevance propagation exhibited concurrence with the domain knowledge, with the Shapley value explanation method presenting the most reliable results. },

	abstract = {This study explores a deep-learning-based dose rate estimation model for a large-volume plastic scintillation detector. Large-volume plastic scintillators are typically utilized as detector materials for radiation portal monitors (RPMs); however, they can also be utilized for environmental radiation monitoring. We introduced a deep-learning approach to estimate the ambient dose equivalent (H*(10)) from the spectral input using a transformer architecture. The performance of the model was compared with that of other models with conventional architectures and verified using simulated and measured spectra. In addition, we present a model explanation and an uncertainty quantification approach to ensure the reliability of the dose rate estimation model. Our verification demonstrates that the behavior of the model aligns with domain knowledge and that the uncertainty of the model's estimations increases according to the increment in the statistical uncertainties of the input spectra. The experimental results indicate that the model shows a promising performance as a practical application for RPMs.},

@article{Jeon2021PseudoGamma,
	abstract = {Although plastic scintillation detectors possess poor spectroscopic characteristics, they are extensively used in various fields for radiation measurement. Several methods have been proposed to facilitate their application of plastic scintillation detectors for spectroscopic measurement. However, most of these detectors can only be used for identifying radioisotopes. In this study, we present a multitask model for pseudo-gamma spectroscopy based on a plastic scintillation detector. A deep- learning model is implemented using multitask learning and trained through supervised learning. Eight gamma-ray sources are used for dataset generation. Spectra are simulated using a Monte Carlo N-Particle code (MCNP 6.2) and measured using a polyvinyl toluene detector for dataset generation based on gamma-ray source information. The spectra of single and multiple gamma-ray sources are generated using the random sampling technique and employed as the training dataset for the proposed model. The hyperparameters of the model are tuned using the Bayesian optimization method with the generated dataset. To improve the performance of the deep learning model, a deep learning module with weighted multi-head self-attention is proposed and used in the pseudo-gamma spectroscopy model. The performance of this model is verified using the measured plastic gamma spectra. Furthermore, a performance indicator, namely the minimum required count for single isotopes, is defined using the mean absolute percentage error with a criterion of 1% as the metric to verify the pseudo-gamma spectroscopy performance. The obtained results confirm that the proposed model successfully unfolds the full-energy peaks and predicts the relative radioactivity, even in spectra with statistical uncertainties.},

	abstract = {The plastic scintillation optical fiber (PSOF) detector, characterized by its large contact area with measurement targets, effectively detects and quantifies radiation in diverse radiation-contaminated areas and liquid environments. While it is extensively utilized for measuring alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron radiations, comprehensive documentation on the spectrum measurement and energy calibration methods for gamma nuclides has not been reported. Accurate energy calibration is crucial for the precise quantification of radiation doses from various sources. The pulse-height spectrum produced by the PSOF detector does not display a Compton maximum because of the significant Gaussian energy broadening. Additionally, this spectrum compresses as the distance increases between the radiation source and the light measurement device. In this study, the energy spectrum of a PSOF for gamma nuclides was characterized by energy calibrations using Compton edge (CE). The CE channel in the measurement spectrum of the PSOF detector for three gamma nuclides was identified using the first-order differentiation method. This technique was successfully applied to spectra measured at various radiation source positions to determine the attenuation coefficients. The proposed energy calibration method allows for the conversion of pulse-height spectra obtained from alpha, beta, and neutron radiation measured with PSOF detectors into energy spectra.},

	abstract = {The demand for radiation portal monitor (RPM) systems has increased, and their capabilities are being further scrutinized as they are being applied to the task of detecting nuclear weapons, special nuclear material, and radiation dispersal device materials that could appear at borders. The requirements and constraints on RPM systems deployed at high-volume border crossings are significantly different from those at weapons facilities or steel recycling plants, where RPMs have been historically employed. In this new homeland security application, RPM systems must rapidly detect localized sources of radiation with a very high detection probability and low false-alarm rate, while screening all of the traffic without impeding the flow of commerce. In light of this new Department of Homeland Security application, the capabilities of two popular gamma-ray-detector materials as applied to these needs are re-examined. Both experimental data and computer simulations, together with practical deployment experience, are used to assess currently available polyvinyltoluene and NaI(Tl) gamma-ray detectors for border applications.},

@article{Kamuda2019AnAutomated,
	abstract = {There is a need to develop an automated isotope identification and quantification algorithm that can perform well using low-resolution gamma-ray detectors. The algorithm should be able to perform well on spectra that contain a mixture of many isotopes as well as in cases where spectral features are difficult to analyze. Due to the low resolution of these detectors, spectra of isotope mixtures becomes complicated to identify when features overlap. Previous research applying machine learning algorithms to isotope identification has been promising. Further work is needed to demonstrate the limits of machine learning algorithms when applied to identifying mixtures of isotopes and spectra where features are not obvious. Because machine learning algorithms use abstract features of the spectrum, such as the shape of overlapping peaks and Compton continuum, they are a natural choice for analyzing isotope mixtures. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) has be trained to calculate the relative activities of 29 isotopes in a spectrum. The ANN is trained with simulated gamma-ray spectra, allowing custom datasets to be generated for specific identification tasks. The algorithms performance on simulated spectra without apparent features and on simulated isotope mixtures are both analyzed.},
